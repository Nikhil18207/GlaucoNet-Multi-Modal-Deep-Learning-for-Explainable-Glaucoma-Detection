# 🔬 Glaucoma Detection using Multi-Modal AI

Early Diagnosis with CDR, Deep Features & Ensemble Learning
🧠 ORIGA & ACRIMA Datasets | 🔍 Explainability with Grad-CAM (Ongoing)

✅ Project Overview
This research project focuses on building a multi-modal AI pipeline for glaucoma detection by combining:
Line one Clinical features (like Cup-to-Disc Ratio - CDR)
Line two Deep image features extracted using ResNet50
Line three Ensemble learning, threshold tuning, and explainability tools
