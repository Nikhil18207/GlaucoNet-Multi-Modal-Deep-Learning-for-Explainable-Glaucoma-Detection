# 🔬 Glaucoma Detection using Multi-Modal AI

Early Diagnosis with CDR, Deep Features & Ensemble Learning
🧠 ORIGA & ACRIMA Datasets | 🔍 Explainability with Grad-CAM (Ongoing)

✅ Project Overview
This research project focuses on building a multi-modal AI pipeline for glaucoma detection by combining:

1) Clinical features (like Cup-to-Disc Ratio - CDR)

2) Line two Deep image features extracted using ResNet50

3) Line three Ensemble learning, threshold tuning, and explainability tools

# 📌 Datasets Used

🟢 ORIGA Dataset: Fundus images + Segmentation masks + Labels

🔵 ACRIMA Dataset: Fundus images + Glaucoma labels (No masks)
